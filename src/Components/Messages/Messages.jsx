              Sports is not just about physical exercise and competition. It
              instils team spirit, leadership qualities, and develops
              performance character traits such as grit, resilience, and
              self-discipline. Its benefits are not limited only to those who
              play, but also to those who watch and support the players. DIT
              University’s annual sports festival Sphurti is one of the
              occasions that brings all DITians together

                      manner befitting the occasion.

              I take great pleasure in welcoming all students and sports persons
              to the SPHURTI-2024, the eighth annual sports meet of DIT
              University, from 13th March to 15 March 2024. On this occasion, I
              extend my warm wishes to all the sports persons with a great motto
              of &quot;Aim for excellence, not perfection.&quot; we will form
              the nucleus of change when we combine efforts with those who have
              walked the path before us are

                    combine efforts with those who have walked the path before
                    us and are standing ready to create a year of not just being
                    competitive but one of athletic dominance. Once you’ve
                    prepared mentally and physically for your game, then you are
                    ready to do your best-and your best is the best you can do.

                    The DIT University, Dehradun, under the leadership of
                    Hon&apos;ble vice Chancellor, Prof. G. Raghurama is fully
                    committed for all around development and empowerment of
                    students so that they can realize their full potential and
                    also contribute to the career-building process. Not only
                    that, the DIT University, Dehradun is focused on Scientific
                    development and firmly holds the view that the students
                    should be active participants and not just passive
                    recipients of the knowledge process. Sports play a key role
                    in development of personality of the students. In fact,
                    sports should be a way of life. I call upon the students to
                    make sports an integral part of their life.
